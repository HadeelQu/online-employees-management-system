## About project
Superviso is an online employee management website where employees can request different services (i.e., promotion, leave, resignation, allowance, health insurance), and a manager can approve or decline the request.
	
## Features
* Home page that provides links to log in as an employee or a manager. It also gives the option for new employees to ‘sign-up’
* Employee sign up page (linked in the system’s home page) that enables new employees to create a new account. The page should ask for the employee's ID, first name, last name, job title, and password. The form redirects the user to the employee’s home page.
* Employee log-in page that asks for employee’s ID and password then redirects to the employee’s home page.
* Manager log-in page that asks for username and password then redirects to the manager’s home page.
* Employee home page that contains their information (first name, last name, ID and job title), a list of their requests, the ability to edit each of the requests, the ability to add a new request, and a ‘sign-out’ link that redirects to the system’s home page.
Each request is displayed as a combination of request’s ID and service type, and it links to ‘request information page’.
* Add new request: A form for adding a new request. The form asks for the service type, description, and it allows to upload at most 2 attachments. The form redirects to the request information page.
* Manager home page that contains the manager’s name, and a list of requests, and a ‘sign-out’ link that redirects to the system’s home page .
The requests should be categorized based on the service type. Also, the status of each request (In progress, approved or declined) is shown, and ‘approve’ and ‘decline’ links/buttons should be presented beside each request. Each request is displayed as a combination of request ID and employee’s name, and it links to ‘request information page’.
The ‘In progress’ requests should be in the top of the list for each service with the options to approve or decline. Other requests only have an option to reverse their status.
